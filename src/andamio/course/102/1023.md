To answer this question, we need to think about the structure of decentralized applications on Cardano. There are two key ideas you need to understand: **Validators** and **Transactions**.

In this course, you will learn a lot about both by practicing with some examples.

The purpose of this lesson is to give you a place to start. If it doesn't make sense right away, don't worry. We will revisit these concepts frequently throughout the course, and you will have many chances to practice using them.

## Key Concept #1: Validators
Cardano is built on the "Extended UTxO Model", which is usually abbreviated as "EUTxO". You can learn more about EUTxOs in:
- [Plutus PBL](https://plutuspbl.io) from Gimbalabs
- [The Cardano Blockchain Certified Associate course](https://academy.cardanofoundation.org/) from Cardano Foundation

Here is the basic idea. If you have a wallet holding any assets on Cardano, then you have an address that holds a set of "extended UTxOs". Each UTxO holds some assets. The sum of all of the assets in the set of UTxOs at your wallet address is the "balance" of your wallet. Try this:

1. Go to [Cexplorer.io](https://cexplorer.io/)
2. In the search bar, paste an address of your wallet
3. You should see a page called "Address Detail". It shows the balance of your wallet and some other details.
4. You will see a list of tabs. Select **UTXO**:

> Note: This example comes from the [Preprod version of Cexplorer](https://preprod.cexplorer.io/)

Whenever you send assets from your wallet to another address, you "spend" one or more of your UTxOs. This is called a transaction. On Cardano, transactions can be valid - meaning that they can actually be executed on the blockchain - or they can be invalid - or not able to be executed on-chain.

When you want to send a transaction, you must sign it. Your signature is what makes the transaction valid, by "unlocking" one or more of the UTxOs in your wallet. Any transaction that spends UTxOs from a wallet must be signed, or else it will be invalid.

Here's where things get really interesting. With a "smart contract", you can write customized rules for how UTxOs are unlocked. These UTxOs are not held in user wallets like yours or mine, they are held at "Contract" addresses. A **contract address** looks just like a **wallet address**, but under the hood there's some magic going on. In order to spend UTxOs from a contract address, all we have to do is follow some custom rules. These custom rules are written in something called a "Validator".

When we talk about "writing a smart contract in Plutus", we should be more specific about what that means. A better way to say it is that we are "writing validators in PlutusTx". Validators can be written in many different languages, and maybe you have heard about them: [PlutusTx](), [Aiken](), [Helios](), [opshin](), [Plutarch](), or [plu-ts](). This list will continue to grow along with Cardano.

- The Aiken team published a great [EUTxO Crash Course](https://aiken-lang.org/fundamentals/eutxo). We really recommend reading this one!

## Key Concept #2: Transaction Building
So if validators are responsible for writing custom rules, what does Mesh do?

Mesh is not a programming language for writing validators. Instead, Mesh is built so that developers can build applications that interact with validators that have already been written in any of the languages listed above.

Specifically, Mesh can help you build apps that:
- view blockchain information
- build transactions.

Module 101 introduced some ways to view information about a wallet that is connected to an application. Module 102 introduced "Providers", which allow you get information from the entire blockchain. We will continue to look at ways to view blockchain information in this course.

In order to build interactive applications that can "change" the blockchain, you must be able to build valid transactions. Mesh is a really good tool for helping developers to build transactions in applications. If you are a "Mesh Developer", you'll want to learn a lot about building transactions.

And that's what we're going to do in this course. Ready?
