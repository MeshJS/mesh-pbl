## Introduction

In the [Course 200.6](/course/module/200/2006) of the Transactions Instance module, you have learned how to delegate stake to a stake pool using the Mesh Transaction Instance, which you will imitate and build a similar transaction using the lower level transaction APIs provided by MeshTxBuilder in this lesson. 

However, the staking related APIs are not currently implemented in the `MeshTxBuilder` instance yet and therefore, if you were to build a transaction for delegating stake, you would have to use the Mesh Transaction Instance mentioned in [Module 200](/course/module/200/2006) for now. This course will be updated once the corresponding APIs are implemented from Mesh.
