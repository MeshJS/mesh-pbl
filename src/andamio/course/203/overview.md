### Introduction to Module 203

In this module, you will learn how to build the transaction similar to the ones in the [previous module](/course/module/200/overview), but utilizing the lower level transaction building method. Mesh provided `MeshTxBuilder`, a useful set of lower level APIs, allowing developers to build transactions with more flexibility and control.

### Resources

To learn more about the MeshTxBuilder, you can read the official documentations on all functions at [MeshTxBuilder - All API Endpoints](https://meshjs.dev/apis/transaction/builder) and examples at [MeshTxBuilder - Craft Customized Transactions](https://meshjs.dev/apis/transaction/builderExample).

MeshTxBuilder is implemented based on the design of the lower level CLI commands in `cardano-cli`. You can learn more about it at [Cardano Docs](https://docs.cardano.org/development-guidelines/use-cli/).
