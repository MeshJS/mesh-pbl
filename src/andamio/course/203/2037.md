## Introduction

In the [Course 200.7](/course/module/200/2007) of the Transactions Instance module, you have learned how to build an app component that allows users to to sign verified messages using the Mesh Transaction Instance, which is actually the easiest and most straightforward way to implement this feature. Therefore, it is recommended to use the Mesh Transaction Instance instead if you were to build a transaction for signing verified messages.

You can revisit [Course 200.7](/course/module/200/2007) to facilitate your learning.
