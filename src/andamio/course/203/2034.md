## Introduction

In the [Transactions Instance](/course/module/200/2004) module, you learned how to build a transaction that requires multiple signatures using the Mesh Transaction Instance which you will imitate and build a similar transaction using the lower level transaction APIs provided by MeshTxBuilder in this lesson.

---

### Step 1: Setting up the MeshTxBuilder instance

Firstly, initialize your `MeshTxBuilder` instance and get the UTxOs required for transaction as learned in the [previous lesson](/course/module/203/2031). You can skip this step if the project is already set up.

```typescript
import { MaestroProvider, MeshTxBuilder } from "@meshsdk/core";

const maestro = new MaestroProvider({
  network: "Preprod",
  apiKey: YOUR_MAESTRO_API_KEY,
});

const mesh = new MeshTxBuilder({
  fetcher: maestro,
  submitter: maestro,
  evaluator: maestro,
});

const getUtxosWithMinLovelace = async (lovelace: number) => {
  let utxos: UTxO[] = await maestro.fetchAddressUTxOs(address!);
  return utxos.filter((utxo) => {
    const lovelaceAmount = utxo.output.amount.find(
      (asset: any) => asset.unit === "lovelace"
    )?.quantity;
    return Number(lovelaceAmount) > lovelace;
  });
};
```

---

### Step 2: Building a Transaction with Multi-Signature

You can build a transaction that requires multiple signatures. Here is an example on how to do it:

```typescript
const convertTokenName = (name: string) => {
  return Buffer.from(name, "utf8").toString("hex");
};

const sendFundMultiSig = async () => {
  const utxos = await getUtxosWithMinLovelace(10000000);
  const txInHash = utxos[0].input.txHash;
  const txInId = utxos[0].input.outputIndex;
  await mesh
    .txIn(txInHash, txInId)
    .txOut(RECIPIENT_ADDRESS, [{ unit: "lovelace", quantity: "5000000" }])
    .changeAddress(RECIPIENT_ADDRESS)
    .requiredSignerHash(pubKeyHash)
    .signingKey(SIGNING_KEY)
    .complete();

  const txHex = mesh.completeSigning();

  const signedTx = await wallet.signTx(txHex, true);

  const txHash = await mesh.submitTx(signedTx);

  console.log("txHash", txHash);
};
```

In the provided code, you created the same transaction you built in the [203.1 lesson](/course/module/203/2031) to lovelace to your own address. The only difference is that you added the `requiredSignerHash` command to the transaction builder to instruct that the transaction requires multiple signatures to be valid. 

Notice that in the `mesh.completeSigning()` operation, the transaction is only signed once with the signing key and would need another signature matching the public key hash specified. Therefore, you can use the `signTx` function of the Browser Wallet by passing the hex string of transaction and setting the partial sign flag to `true`. It will prompt the user to sign the transaction with their browser wallet on the client side, hence completing the multi-signature transaction.

---

### Step 3: Run and Test your Code

The complete code should be something like the following example:

```typescript

```

Now run the application with `npm run dev` and open a browser, go to the URL `http://localhost:3000`. After connect your wallet, you can try to send fund to your address with the `Send Fund (Multi-Sig)` button which will prompt you to sign the partially-signed transaction with your browser wallet.

You can modify the code examples in this module according to your project ideas. Feel free to make modifications and create something different while applying the same principles from code example above to practice your skills as a developer.
