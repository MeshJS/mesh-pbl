In this lesson, we will learn how to mint tokens with forge script, native script, and plutus scripts.

## Minting on Forge Scripts with one signature

Firstly, we need to define the forgingScript with `ForgeScript`. We use the wallet's first address as the "minting address".

```
const usedAddress = await wallet.getUsedAddresses();
const address = usedAddress[0];

const forgingScript = ForgeScript.withOneSignature(address);
```

Next, we define the asset metadata and the minting parameters.

```
const asset: Mint = {
  assetName: "MeshToken",
  assetQuantity: "1",
  metadata: assetMetadata,
  label: "721",
  recipient: address,
};
```

Finally, we build the transaction, sign it, and submit it.

```
const tx = new Transaction({ initiator: wallet });

tx.mintAsset(forgingScript, asset);

const unsignedTx = await tx.build();
const signedTx = await wallet.signTx(unsignedTx);
const txHash = await wallet.submitTx(signedTx);
```

## Minting on Native Scripts with policy locking

A locking policy means that the minting transaction is only valid if the native script is satisfied. In this example, we will use a native script with a time lock and a signature. That means the minting transaction is only valid if the current slot number is less than the expiry slot number and the signature is valid. A slot number is a time unit in the Cardano blockchain (1 slot = 1 second).

First, we need to resolve the key hash from the minting address. We can use the `resolvePaymentKeyHash` function to do this.

```
const usedAddress = await wallet.getUsedAddresses();
const address = usedAddress[0];

const keyHash = resolvePaymentKeyHash(address);
```

Next, we define the forgingScript with the native script. 

In order to define the locking policy, we need to define the expiry time of the native script. We can use the `resolveSlotNo` function to extract the slot number of the desired expiry time.

In this example, we set the expiry time to one year from now.

```
// get slot number of expiry
let oneYearFromNow = new Date();
oneYearFromNow.setFullYear(oneYearFromNow.getFullYear() + 1);
const slot = resolveSlotNo("preprod", oneYearFromNow.getTime());

const nativeScript: NativeScript = {
  type: "all",
  scripts: [
    {
      type: "before",
      slot: slot,
    },
    {
      type: "sig",
      keyHash: keyHash,
    },
  ],
};

const forgingScript = ForgeScript.fromNativeScript(nativeScript);
```

Finally, we build the transaction, sign it, and submit it.

```
const asset: Mint = {
  assetName: "MeshToken",
  assetQuantity: "1",
  metadata: assetMetadata,
  label: "721",
  recipient: address,
};

const tx = new Transaction({ initiator: wallet });
tx.mintAsset(forgingScript, asset);
tx.setTimeToExpire(slot);

const unsignedTx = await tx.build();
const signedTx = await wallet.signTx(unsignedTx);
const txHash = await wallet.submitTx(signedTx);
```

## Minting on Plutus Scripts

Minting with Plutus scripts is a bit more complex. We need to define the forgingScript with the plutus script and the datum. In this example, we will use a simple datum that requires a valid message. We will use Aiken to write the smart contract.

The smart contract's validators is as follows:

```
fn mint_with_contract(redeemer: MintRedeemer, context: ScriptContext) {
  let ScriptContext { purpose, .. } = context
  expect Mint(_) = purpose
  redeemer.message == "mesh"
}
```

This contract will only mint tokens if the redeemer's message is "mesh". See [contract code](https://github.com/MeshJS/mesh-pbl-student-library/blob/main/src/pages/2011-minting/plutus-script/contract/validators/mint-with-contract.ak) for more details.

First, we need to define the plutus script by encoding the compiled smart contract CBOR.

```
const script: PlutusScript = {
  code: cbor
    .encode(Buffer.from(plutusScript.validators[0].compiledCode, "hex"))
    .toString("hex"),
  version: "V2",
};
```

Next, we define redeemer, which is the data that will be used to validate the plutus script. In this example, we will use a simple redeemer that requires a valid message, "mesh".

```
const redeemer = {
  data: { alternative: 0, fields: ["mesh"] },
  tag: "MINT",
};
```

Next, we define the asset metadata and the minting parameters.

```
const address = (await wallet.getUsedAddresses())[0];

const asset: Mint = {
  assetName: "MeshToken",
  assetQuantity: "1",
  metadata: assetMetadata,
  label: "721",
  recipient: address,
};
```

Finally, we build the transaction, sign it, and submit it.

```
const tx = new Transaction({ initiator: wallet })
  .mintAsset(script, asset, redeemer)
  .setRequiredSigners([address]);

const unsignedTx = await tx.build();
const signedTx = await wallet.signTx(unsignedTx, true);
const txHash = await wallet.submitTx(signedTx);
```
