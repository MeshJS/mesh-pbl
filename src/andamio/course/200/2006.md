## Why delegate stake?

When you hold ADA in a wallet, you also hold a stake in the Cardano network, proportional to the amount. Stake could be delegated to a stake pool, which is a group of people who combined their resources to increase the chance of being chosen to mint a new block. In return, the participators will share the rewards from the process.

## Lesson Overview 

In this lesson, you will learn how to get the reward address from the users and register their reward address for staking. The user will be able to stake their ADA to a stake pool through your application. 

## Part-1: Connect Wallet and Get Wallet Information

Firstly, you have to allow the user to connect their wallet to get their information. You can use the methods learned in previous lessons. For example, the built-in `CardanoWallet` Mesh component, or build the logic yourself using the `useWallet()` React hook.

```typescript
import { useWallet, CardanoWallet, MeshProvider } from "@meshsdk/react";

export const Staking = () => {
  const { connected, wallet } = useWallet();

  return (
    <MeshProvider>
      <div>
        <CardanoWallet />
      </div>
    </MeshProvider>
  );
};
```

Once the user has connected their wallet, you can obtain wallet information, such as the reward address:

```typescript
import { useWallet } from "@meshsdk/react";
import { useEffect, useState } from "react";

export default function StakingPage() {
  const { wallet, connected } = useWallet();
  const [rewardAddress, setRewardAddress] = useState("");

  useEffect(() => {
    if (connected) {
      wallet?.getRewardAddresses().then((addresses) => {
        console.log("reward addresses: ", addresses);
        setRewardAddress(addresses[0]);
      });
    }
  }, [connected]);

  return (
    <div className="p-3">
      {connected ? <p>Connected</p> : <p>Not Connected</p>}
      {rewardAddress ? (
        <p>Reward Address: {rewardAddress}</p>
      ) : (
        <p>Fetching Reward Address...</p>
      )}
    </div>
  );
}
```

In the provided code, you utilized a connected Browser Wallet instance to retrieve associated reward addresses. The `getRewardAddresses()` method returns an array of reward addresses. Consequently, you can use the first wallet's address from the array for subsequent steps.

## Part-2: Delegate the Stake to a Stake Pool

Prior to enabling the user to delegate their stake, their address must be registered. You can use the `registerStakeAddress()` method for address registration. Subsequently, you can use the `delegateStake()` method to delegate the stake to a stake pool.

```typescript 
import { Transaction } from "@meshsdk/core";
import { useWallet } from "@meshsdk/react";
import { useEffect, useState } from "react";

export default function StakingPage() {
  const { wallet, connected } = useWallet();
  const [rewardAddress, setRewardAddress] = useState("");

  useEffect(() => {
    if (connected) {
      wallet?.getRewardAddresses().then((addresses) => {
        console.log("reward addresses: ", addresses);
        setRewardAddress(addresses[0]);
      });
    }
  }, [connected]);

  const delegateStake = async () => {
    const poolId = "pool1mhww3q6d7qssj5j2add05r7cyr7znyswe2g6vd23anpx5sh6z8d"; // Gimbalabs stake pool

    try {
      const tx = new Transaction({ initiator: wallet });
      tx.registerStake(rewardAddress);
      tx.delegateStake(rewardAddress, poolId);
      const unsignedTx = await tx.build();
      const signedTx = await wallet.signTx(unsignedTx);
      const txHash = await wallet.submitTx(signedTx);
      return txHash;
    } catch (error) {
      console.log("Staking error: ", error);
      return "error";
    }
  };

  return (
    <div className="p-3">
      {connected ? (
        <>
          <p>Connected</p>
          {rewardAddress ? (
            <p>Reward Address: {rewardAddress}</p>
          ) : (
            <p>Fetching Reward Address...</p>
          )}
          <button
            onClick={delegateStake}
            className="bg-blue-500 hover:bg-blue-700 text-white font-bold py-2 px-4 rounded"
          >
            Delegate Stake
          </button>
        </>
      ) : (
        <>
          <p>Wallet Not Connected</p>
          <p>Connect your wallet before delegating stake</p>
        </>
      )}
    </div>
  );
}
```

In the provided code, you built a transaction that first used the `registerStakeAddress()` method to register the reward address of the user. Then, the `delegateStake()` method is used to delegate the stake to a stake pool. The Gimbalabs pool is used in this example. You could use any pre-prod stake pool for testing.

You can now run `npm run dev` and go to http://localhost:3000 to see the result. After you connect your wallet, you should see the reward address and be able to delegate your stake to a stake pool by clicking the button.

## Part-3: Further Integration

Beyond connecting the wallet and delegating stake, you can leverage blockchain providers like [Maestro](https://www.gomaestro.org/) and [BlockFrost](https://blockfrost.io/) to access details about the user's wallet and the stake pool. For instance, you could verify if the reward address is registered and whether the stake is delegated to a particular pool.

```typescript
import { Configuration, MaestroClient } from '@maestro-org/typescript-sdk'

const maestroClient = new MaestroClient(
    new Configuration({
        apiKey: 'your-api-key',
        network: 'Preprod'
    })
)

const checkIfStaked = async (rewardAddress: string) => {
    const info = await maestroClient.accounts.accountInfo(rewardAddress)
    const { registered, delegated_pool } = info.data.data
    return { registered, staked: delegated_pool === 'your_pool_id' }
}
```

You can then use the information to improve the application user experience:

```typescript
const delegateStake = async () => {
    const poolId = "pool1mhww3q6d7qssj5j2add05r7cyr7znyswe2g6vd23anpx5sh6z8d"; // Gimbalabs stake pool
    if (await checkIfStaked(rewardAddress)) {
        console.log('Already staked')
        // Do something else to appreciate the support
    } else {
        try {
            const tx = new Transaction({ initiator: wallet });
            if (!registered) {
                tx.registerStake(rewardAddress);
            }
            tx.delegateStake(rewardAddress, poolId);
            const unsignedTx = await tx.build();
            const signedTx = await wallet.signTx(unsignedTx);
            const txHash = await wallet.submitTx(signedTx);
            return txHash;
        } catch (error) {
            console.log("Staking error: ", error);
            return "error";
        }
    }
};
```
