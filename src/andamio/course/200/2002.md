## Introduction

In this lesson, you will learn how to make a Cardano transaction to send assets using the Mesh SDK. You will learn how to build a transaction to send native tokens, a stable coin, and send assets in a UTXO. 

### Prerequisites

- [Setup your project](/course/module/101/1012)
- [Build basic transactions](/course/module/200/2001)

### Send native tokens

In order to send native tokens, you need to specify the `unit` and `quantity` of the token you want to send. A `unit` is a concatenation of the policy id and asset name. In this example, we will send 1 token asset to an address.

```typescript
import { Transaction } from '@meshsdk/core';
import type { Asset } from '@meshsdk/core';

const tx = new Transaction({ initiator: wallet })
  .sendAssets(
    'addr_test1vpvx0sacufuypa2k4sngk7q40zc5c4npl337uusdh64kv0c7e4cxr',
    [
      {
        unit: '64af286e2ad0df4de2e7de15f8ff5b3d27faecf4ab2757056d860a424d657368546f6b656e',
        quantity: '1',
      },
    ]
  );

const unsignedTx = await tx.build();
const signedTx = await wallet.signTx(unsignedTx);
const txHash = await wallet.submitTx(signedTx);
```

In this example, we create a new transaction object and call the `sendAssets` method to send assets. We pass the recipient address and an array of assets to send. Each asset object in the array contains the `unit` and `quantity` of the asset to send.

### Send tokens and lovelace

We can chain the `sendLovelace` and `sendAssets` methods to send both lovelace and assets in the same transaction. In this example, we will send 1 token asset and 1 ADA to an address.

```typescript
import { Transaction } from '@meshsdk/core';
import type { Asset } from '@meshsdk/core';

const tx = new Transaction({ initiator: wallet })
  .sendLovelace(
    'addr_test1vpvx0sacufuypa2k4sngk7q40zc5c4npl337uusdh64kv0c7e4cxr',
    '1000000'
  )
  .sendAssets(
    'addr_test1vpvx0sacufuypa2k4sngk7q40zc5c4npl337uusdh64kv0c7e4cxr',
    [
      {
        unit: '64af286e2ad0df4de2e7de15f8ff5b3d27faecf4ab2757056d860a424d657368546f6b656e',
        quantity: '1',
      },
    ]
  );

const unsignedTx = await tx.build();
const signedTx = await wallet.signTx(unsignedTx);
const txHash = await wallet.submitTx(signedTx);
```

In this example, we chain the `sendLovelace` and `sendAssets` methods to send both lovelace and assets in the same transaction. We first call the `sendLovelace` method to send 1 ADA to the recipient address, then call the `sendAssets` method to send 1 token asset to the same address.

### Send stable coins

Some popular (or high volume) stable coins are included in Mesh SDK. In this example, we will send DJED stable coin to an address.

```typescript
import { Transaction } from '@meshsdk/core';

const tx = new Transaction({ initiator: wallet })
  .sendToken(
    'addr_test1vpvx0sacufuypa2k4sngk7q40zc5c4npl337uusdh64kv0c7e4cxr', 
    'DJED', 
    '1000000'
  )
;

const unsignedTx = await tx.build();
const signedTx = await wallet.signTx(unsignedTx);
const txHash = await wallet.submitTx(signedTx);
```

In this example, we create a new transaction object and call the `sendToken` method to send DJED stable coin. We pass the recipient address, token name, and quantity of the token to send.

### Send assets in UTXO

A Cardano `UTXO` is an output from a previous transaction that can be used as an input in a new transaction. This is useful when executing transactions that involve smart contracts.

```typescript
import { Transaction } from '@meshsdk/core';

const tx = new Transaction({ initiator: wallet })
  .sendValue(recipient, UTxO);

const unsignedTx = await tx.build();
const signedTx = await wallet.signTx(unsignedTx);
const txHash = await wallet.submitTx(signedTx);
```

In this example, we create a new transaction object and call the `sendValue` method to send assets in a UTXO. We pass the recipient address and the UTXO object to send.

## Conclusion

In this lesson, you learned how to make a Cardano transaction to send assets using the Mesh SDK. You learned how to send native tokens, stable coins, and assets in a UTXO.
