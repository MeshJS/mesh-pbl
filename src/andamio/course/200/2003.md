In this lesson, we will learn how to mint tokens using three different methods: using first just a basic forging script, then a native script, and then a plutus script.

## Minting using ForgeScript with one signature

This is the simplest method, enabling us to mint tokens very easily with using as little as one signature. 

Firstly, we need to define the forging script using `ForgeScript`. Here we are using the wallet's first address as the "minting address".

```
const usedAddress = await wallet.getUsedAddresses();
const address = usedAddress[0];

const forgingScript = ForgeScript.withOneSignature(address);
```

Next, we define the asset metadata and the minting parameters.  The structure of the metadata object is defined in [CIP-25 (Media Token Metadata Standard)](https://cips.cardano.org/cip/CIP-25/.).

```
const asset: Mint = {
  assetName: "MeshToken",
  assetQuantity: "1",
  metadata: assetMetadata,
  label: "721",
  recipient: address,
};
```

Finally, we build the transaction, sign it, and submit it as usual.

```
const tx = new Transaction({ initiator: wallet });

tx.mintAsset(forgingScript, asset);

const unsignedTx = await tx.build();
const signedTx = await wallet.signTx(unsignedTx);
const txHash = await wallet.submitTx(signedTx);
```

## Minting using Native Scripts with policy locking

A locking policy specifies that a minting transaction is valid if (and only if) all of the conditions specified in the native script are satisfied. In this example, we will use a native script with a time lock and a signature i.e. the minting transaction will only be valid if the signature is valid AND the current slot number is less than the specified expiry slot number. A [slot](https://www.essentialcardano.io/faq/what-are-blocks-slots-and-epochs) is a time unit in the Cardano blockchain (1 slot ~ 1 second).

First, we need to resolve (obtain) the key hash from the minting address, because we need to provide this as a parameter in the script definition. We can use the `resolvePaymentKeyHash` function to do this.

```
const usedAddress = await wallet.getUsedAddresses();
const address = usedAddress[0];

const keyHash = resolvePaymentKeyHash(address);
```

Next, we define the forging script using ForgeScript, but this time using a native script which describes the required conditions i.e. the appropriate locking policy. 

In order to define the locking policy, we need to specify the expiry time of the native script. We can use the `resolveSlotNo` function to obtain the slot number of the desired expiry time.

In this example, we set the expiry time to one year from now.

```
// get slot number of expiry
let oneYearFromNow = new Date();
oneYearFromNow.setFullYear(oneYearFromNow.getFullYear() + 1);
const slot = resolveSlotNo("preprod", oneYearFromNow.getTime());

const nativeScript: NativeScript = {
  type: "all",
  scripts: [
    {
      type: "before",
      slot: slot,
    },
    {
      type: "sig",
      keyHash: keyHash,
    },
  ],
};

const forgingScript = ForgeScript.fromNativeScript(nativeScript);
```

Finally, we define the metadata, build the transaction, sign it, and submit it, just as before.

```
const asset: Mint = {
  assetName: "MeshToken",
  assetQuantity: "1",
  metadata: assetMetadata,
  label: "721",
  recipient: address,
};

const tx = new Transaction({ initiator: wallet });
tx.mintAsset(forgingScript, asset);
tx.setTimeToExpire(slot);

const unsignedTx = await tx.build();
const signedTx = await wallet.signTx(unsignedTx);
const txHash = await wallet.submitTx(signedTx);
```

## Minting using Plutus Scripts

Minting with Plutus scripts is a bit more complicated since we need to define a forging script with both a plutus script AND a datum. In this example, we will use a simple datum that specifies the exact message that will be required to validate a minting transaction. We will use [Aiken](https://aiken-lang.org/) to write the smart contract (which is then compiled down to create a Plutus script).

The smart contract's validator is as follows:

```
fn mint_with_contract(redeemer: MintRedeemer, context: ScriptContext) {
  let ScriptContext { purpose, .. } = context
  expect Mint(_) = purpose
  redeemer.message == "mesh"
}
```

This contract will only mint tokens if the redeemer's message is "mesh". See [Aiken contract code](https://github.com/MeshJS/mesh-pbl-student-library/blob/main/src/pages/2011-minting/plutus-script/contract/validators/mint-with-contract.ak) for more details.

First, we need to define the plutus script by encoding the compiled smart contract CBOR.

```
const script: PlutusScript = {
  code: cbor
    .encode(Buffer.from(plutusScript.validators[0].compiledCode, "hex"))
    .toString("hex"),
  version: "V2",
};
```

Next, we define `redeemer`, which is the data that will be used to validate the plutus script. In this example, we will use a simple redeemer that contains a valid message i.e. "mesh".

```
const redeemer = {
  data: { alternative: 0, fields: ["mesh"] },
  tag: "MINT",
};
```

Next, we define the asset metadata and the minting parameters.

```
const address = (await wallet.getUsedAddresses())[0];

const asset: Mint = {
  assetName: "MeshToken",
  assetQuantity: "1",
  metadata: assetMetadata,
  label: "721",
  recipient: address,
};
```

Finally, we build the transaction, sign it, and submit it.

```
const tx = new Transaction({ initiator: wallet })
  .mintAsset(script, asset, redeemer)
  .setRequiredSigners([address]);

const unsignedTx = await tx.build();
const signedTx = await wallet.signTx(unsignedTx, true);
const txHash = await wallet.submitTx(signedTx);
```
