2. **Minting Transactions**: These transactions involve the creation of new tokens.
3. **Staking Transactions**: These transactions involve the delegation of stake to a stake pool.
4. **Smart Contract Transactions**: These transactions involve the execution of smart contracts on the Cardano blockchain.
