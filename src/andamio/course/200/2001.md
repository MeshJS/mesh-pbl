## Introduction

In this lesson, you will learn how to make a Cardano transaction by sending some lovelace to one or more addresses. This is the first step in building a transaction using the Mesh SDK.

### Prerequisites

- [Setup your project](/course/module/101/1012)

### What is Transaction

A transaction represents an action initiated, authenticated, and dispatched by a user to alter the state of the ledger. Its primary function typically involves the transfer of ada or other tokens between users. Moreover, transactions can fulfill multiple objectives, including token generation, delegation enrollment to a stake pool, or engagement with smart contracts, among other functionalities. The sequence to modify the ledger via a transaction unfolds as follows:

1. **Create a Transaction**: The user creates a transaction with the desired inputs and outputs.
2. **Sign the Transaction**: The user signs the transaction with their private key.
3. **Submit the Transaction**: The user submits the signed transaction to the network.
4. **Transaction Confirmation**: The transaction is confirmed by the network and added to the ledger.

## Build a Transaction to send to 1 Address

Sending to a receipient is the most common type of transaction. In this example, we will send 1000000 lovelace (1 ADA) to a single address.

```typescript
import { Transaction } from '@meshsdk/core';

const tx = new Transaction({ initiator: wallet })
  .sendLovelace(
    'addr_test1vpvx0sacufuypa2k4sngk7q40zc5c4npl337uusdh64kv0c7e4cxr',
    '1000000'
  )
;

const unsignedTx = await tx.build();
const signedTx = await wallet.signTx(unsignedTx);
const txHash = await wallet.submitTx(signedTx);
```

In this example, we create a new transaction object with the `Transaction` class and call the `sendLovelace` method to send 1 ADA to the specified address. We then build the transaction, sign it with the wallet, and submit it to the network.

## Build a Transaction to send to Multiple Addresses

Sending to multiple addresses is easily achieved by calling the `sendLovelace` method multiple times. In this example, we will send 1000000 lovelace (1 ADA) to two addresses.

```typescript
import { Transaction } from '@meshsdk/core';

const tx = new Transaction({ initiator: wallet });

tx.sendLovelace(
  'addr_test1vpvx0sacufuypa2k4sngk7q40zc5c4npl337uusdh64kv0c7e4cxr',
  '1000000'
);
tx.sendLovelace(
  'addr_another_address',
  '1000000'
);
;

const unsignedTx = await tx.build();
const signedTx = await wallet.signTx(unsignedTx);
const txHash = await wallet.submitTx(signedTx);
```

In this example, we create a new transaction object with the `Transaction` class and call the `sendLovelace` method twice to send 1 ADA to two different addresses. We then build the transaction, sign it with the wallet, and submit it to the network.

## Conclusion

In this lesson, you learned how to make a Cardano transaction using the Mesh SDK. You built a transaction to send lovelace to one or more addresses, signed it with the wallet, and submitted it to the network. Transactions are the fundamental building blocks of the Cardano blockchain, enabling users to transfer value, mint tokens, and execute smart contracts.
